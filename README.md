As embedded Linux systems power countless devices in our daily lives, and they’ve become prime targets for cyberattacks. In this in-depth guide to safeguarding your Linux devices, the author leverages his 30+ years of technology experience to help you mitigate the risks associated with hardware and software vulnerabilities.
This book introduces you to the world of embedded systems, the brains behind your everyday appliances. It takes you through the different types of embedded systems, their uses, and the platforms they run on, while addressing their unique security challenges and support considerations. You’ll learn to build a successful, secure, and user-friendly solution by exploring the critical hardware and software components that form the foundation of a secure appliance. We won't forget the human element either; you'll find out how to configure your system to prevent user errors and maintain its integrity. The book lets you put your newfound knowledge into action, guiding you through designing a robust build chain that supports the entire life cycle of your appliance solution, enabling seamless updates without your direct involvement.
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to adapt your appliance to the ever-evolving threat landscape, ensuring its continued security and functionality in real-world conditions.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
In order to get the most out of this book, it is assumed that the reader has some prior experience in
Linux systems administration or experience as a user of Linux systems.
Many of the concepts in this book are extremely advanced. The lessons in this book combined with
your existing knowledge should catapult you to a level of mastery of not only understanding the
internals of Linux systems but also building products based upon Linux.
There are numerous hands-on exercises in this book to enhance the learning activities. Should you
choose to follow along with these exercises, the author recommends having at least two PC-grade
systems with a minimum of 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage each for best results.
